      <h2>Lesson 01 Assignment</h2>
    </header>
    <p> <u>Objective:</u> Create a site using 15 semantic elements that we learned from the slides and readings. Here's hoping I've done it correctly.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Let's Play Two Truths and a Lie</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The closest I've ever come to flying was when I had a longboarding accident going down a small hill where I ditched my board and ate pavement.</li>
          <li>I walked out of school in second grade because I was the new kid who didn't speak English and no one understood me. The culture shock made me do it.</li>
          <li>The love of my life is my precious Goldendoodle named Odd.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Which is the lie?</p>
      <h4>A Few of My Favorite Things</h4>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Doe:</b> A deer, a female deer</li>
          <li> <b>Ray:</b> A drop of golden sun</li>
          <li> <b>Me:</b> A name I call myself</li>
          <li> <b>Far:</b> A long, long way to run</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Here's a nice quote to end on:</h4>
        <blockquote>"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - <i>Maya Angelou</i></blockquote>
